## Snippets

![snippets](images/snippets.gif)

All APIs are filled with every function and options that are commonly used. These are just predictive as you type, but there are also a handful of "snippets" to auto fill your code!

**Note: All snippets include the variable before the function. For example:**

```lua
resolve:GetProjectManager()
```

**The snippets below call variables as well. For example:**

```lua
local resolve = app:GetResolve()
local projectManager = resolve:GetProjectManager()
```
